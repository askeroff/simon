# Simon Game

This is a Simon game implementation. I coded it for practice within the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) curriculum. 

What is it?
==================

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope, The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
